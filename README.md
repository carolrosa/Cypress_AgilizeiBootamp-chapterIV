AgilizeiBootcamp - chapterIV

In this chapter, the first steps were taken with Cypress, creating registration and listing journeys, using random data and introducing the concept of assertions. 
The headless and multibrowser options were explored, as well as adding execution reports using libraries such as mochawesome and getting to know Github Actions for CI.
